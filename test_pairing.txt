Test Setup

>>> from pairvote import pairvote

Scenario:

1. One voter in swing riding is matched to another in a non-swing riding

   Voter Joe in Burnaby-Douglas prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   Voter Sally in Oxford prefers NDP, will vote for Liberal
   Burnaby-Douglas is a NDP swing riding
   Oxford is not a swing riding

   Result: Joe is paired with Sally, Joe votes NDP, Sally votes Liberal

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Burnaby-Douglas","Liberal","NDP",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Oxford","NDP","Liberal",,,,2,
... ''')
,,Joe,,,BURNABY-DOUGLAS,Liberal,NDP,,Y,,1,2
,,Sally,,,OXFORD,NDP,Liberal,,Y,,2,1

2. No match available

   Voter Joe in Burnaby-Douglas prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   Voter Sally in Oxford prefers NDP, will vote for Green
   Burnaby-Douglas is a NDP swing riding
   Oxford is a non-swing riding

   Result: Joe and Sally are not paired

>>> pairvote('''
