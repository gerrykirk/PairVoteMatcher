Test Setup

>>> from pairvote import pairvote

Scenario:

1. One voter in swing riding is matched to another in a non-swing riding

   Voter Joe in Burnaby-Douglas prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   Voter Sally in Oxford prefers NDP, will vote for Liberal
   Burnaby-Douglas is a NDP swing riding
   Oxford is not a swing riding

   Result: Joe is paired with Sally, Joe votes NDP, Sally votes Liberal

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Burnaby-Douglas","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Oxford","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ''')
,,Joe,,,BURNABY-DOUGLAS,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,1,2
,,Sally,,,OXFORD,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,2,1

2. No match available

   Voter Joe in Burnaby-Douglas prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   Voter Sally in Oxford prefers NDP, will vote for Green
   Burnaby-Douglas is a NDP swing riding
   Oxford is a non-swing riding

   Result: Joe and Sally are not paired

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Burnaby-Douglas","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Oxford","NDP","GREEN",,,,2,
... ''')
,,Joe,,,BURNABY-DOUGLAS,LIBERAL,NDP,,,,1,
,,Sally,,,OXFORD,NDP,GREEN,,,,2,

3. One pair found for a swing riding, 1 out of 3 pairings
   made because we are only finding matches for NDP
   Riding A is a NDP swing riding
   Riding B is a non-swing riding

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Alex",,,"Riding A","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,1,
... ,,"Bob",,,"Riding A","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ,,"Chris",,,"Riding A","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,3,

... ,,"Edward",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,5,
... ,,"Frank",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,6,
... ,,"George",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,7,

,,Alex,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,1,6
,,Bob,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,,,2,
,,Chris,,,RIDING A,LIBERAL,GREEN,,,,3,
,,Derek,,,RIDING A,GREEN,LIBERAL,,Y,,4,5
,,Edward,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,GREEN,,Y,,5,4
,,Frank,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,6,1
,,George,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,GREEN,,,,7,

4. UPDATE THIS Pairings found in multiple ridings for multiple parties, 
   not all potential paired persons matched
   
>>> pairvote('''

,,Alex,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,1,6
,,Bob,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,2,11

,,Karl,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,11,2
,,Lenny,,,RIDING B,NDP,GREEN,,,,12,

5. Pairing not made between persons in two swing ridings because
   all pairs made between swing and non-swing ridings

   Voter Joe in Riding A prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   Voter Sally in Riding B prefers NDP, will vote for Liberal
   However, Riding A is a Liberal swing riding and Riding B is an NDP swing riding
   (see ridingsAB.csv) so neither is matched.

   Result: no pairing.

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Riding A","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Riding B","GREEN","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ''', 'ridingsAB.csv')
,,Sally,,,RIDING B,GREEN,LIBERAL,,,,2,
,,Joe,,,RIDING A,LIBERAL,GREEN,,,,1,

6. Pairing not made because person should vote for preferred party
   in their own riding

7. Pairing for person made only once, cannot be selected again

   Alex and Bob both prefer NDP, willing to vote for Liberal. Both
   live in Riding A (LIberal swing riding). Frank prefers Liberal, willing to vote NDP,
   lives in non-swing riding.

   Result: Alex paired with Frank.  No match for Bob (Frank is already matched)
