Test Setup

>>> from pairvote import pairvote

Scenario:

1. One voter in swing riding is matched to another riding

   Voter Joe in Burnaby-Douglas prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   Voter Sally in Oxford prefers NDP, will vote for Liberal
   Burnaby-Douglas is a NDP swing riding
   Oxford is not a swing riding

   Result: Joe is paired with Sally, Joe votes NDP, Sally votes Liberal

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Burnaby-Douglas","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Oxford","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ''')
,,Joe,,,BURNABY-DOUGLAS,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,1,2
,,Sally,,,OXFORD,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,2,1

2. No match available

   Voter Joe in Burnaby-Douglas prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   Voter Sally in Oxford prefers NDP, will vote for Green
   Burnaby-Douglas is a NDP swing riding
   Oxford is a non-swing riding

   Result: Joe and Sally are not paired

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Burnaby-Douglas","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Oxford","NDP","GREEN",,,,2,
... ''')
,,Joe,,,BURNABY-DOUGLAS,LIBERAL,NDP,,,,1,
,,Sally,,,OXFORD,NDP,GREEN,,,,2,

3. One pair found for a swing riding, 1 out of 3 pairings
   made because we are only finding matches for NDP
   Riding A is a NDP swing riding
   Riding B is a non-swing riding

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Alex",,,"Riding A","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,1,
... ,,"Bob",,,"Riding A","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ,,"Chris",,,"Riding A","BLOC","GREEN",,,,3,
... ,,"Derek",,,"Riding A","GREEN","LIBERAL",,,,4,
... ,,"Edward",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,5,
... ,,"Frank",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,6,
... ,,"George",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,7,
... ''', 'ridingsA.csv')
,,Alex,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,1,6
,,Bob,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,,,2,
,,Chris,,,RIDING A,BLOC,GREEN,,,,3,
,,Derek,,,RIDING A,GREEN,LIBERAL,,Y,,4,5
,,Edward,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,GREEN,,Y,,5,4
,,Frank,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,6,1
,,George,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,GREEN,,,,7,

4. Pairings found in multiple ridings for multiple parties, 
   not all potential paired persons matched
   
>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Alex",,,"North Vancouver","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,1,
... ,,"Bob",,,"North Vancouver","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ,,"Chris",,,"Saint Boniface","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,3,
... ,,"Derek",,,"Saint Boniface","GREEN","LIBERAL",,,,4,

... ,,"Igor",,,"Saint Boniface","GREEN","LIBERAL",,,,9,
... ,,"Juan",,,"Saint Boniface","LIBERAL","GREEN",,,,10,
... ,,"Karl",,,"Saint Boniface","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,11,
... ,,"Lenny",,,"Saint Boniface","NDP","GREEN",,,,12,
... ''')
,,Chris,,,Saint Boniface,LIBERAL,GREEN,,Y,,3,4
,,Edward,,,Saint Boniface,LIBERAL,GREEN,,Y,,5,9
,,George,,,Saint Boniface,LIBERAL,GREEN,,,,7,
,,Henry,,,Saint Boniface,NDP,LIBERAL,,,,8,
,,Juan,,,Saint Boniface,LIBERAL,GREEN,,,,10,
,,Lenny,,,Saint Boniface,NDP,GREEN,,,,12,
,,Alex,,,North Vancouver,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,1,6
,,Bob,,,North Vancouver,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,2,11
,,Derek,,,Saint Boniface,GREEN,LIBERAL,,Y,,4,3
,,Frank,,,Saint Boniface,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,6,1
,,Igor,,,Saint Boniface,GREEN,LIBERAL,,Y,,9,5
,,Karl,,,Saint Boniface,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,11,2

5. Pairing not made between persons in two swing ridings because
   all pairs made between swing and non-swing ridings

   Voter Joe in Riding A prefers Green, will vote for Liberal
   Voter Sally in Riding B prefers Liberal, will vote for NDP
   However, Riding A is a Liberal swing riding and Riding B is an NDP swing riding
   (see ridingsAB.csv) so neither is matched.

   Result: no pairing.

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Riding A","GREEN","LIBERAL",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,2,
... ''', 'ridingsAB.csv')
,,Sally,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,NDP,,,,2,
,,Joe,,,RIDING A,GREEN,LIBERAL,,,,1,

6. If a person is in a swing riding and their preferred party is the pick for 
   for that riding, they should vote for their preferred party.

   Mark these users as paired with themselves.

>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Joe",,,"Burnaby-Douglas","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,1,
... ,,"Sally",,,"Oxford","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ,,"Danica",,,"Burnaby-Douglas","NDP","LIBERAL,GREEN",,,,3,
... ''')
,,Joe,,,BURNABY-DOUGLAS,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,1,2
,,Danica,,,BURNABY-DOUGLAS,NDP,"LIBERAL,GREEN",,Y,,3,3
,,Sally,,,OXFORD,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,2,1

7. Pairing for person made only once, cannot be selected again

   Alex and Bob both prefer NDP, willing to vote for Liberal. Both
   live in Riding A (LIberal swing riding). Frank prefers Liberal, willing to vote NDP,
   lives in non-swing riding.

   Result: Alex paired with Frank.  No match for Bob (Frank is already matched)
 
>>> pairvote('''
... ,,"Alex",,,"Riding A","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,1,
... ,,"Bob",,,"Riding A","NDP","LIBERAL",,,,2,
... ,,"Frank",,,"Riding B","LIBERAL","NDP",,,,3,
... ''', 'ridingsA.csv')
,,Alex,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,Y,,1,3
,,Bob,,,RIDING A,NDP,LIBERAL,,,,2,
,,Frank,,,RIDING B,LIBERAL,NDP,,Y,,3,1

8. False positive

   Janell is in Liberal swing riding Riding A and is willing to vote NDP or Liberal; she refers Green.
   Dominic is in a Riding B, prefers NDP and is willing to vote Green, Liberal or Bloc.

   The algorithm was falsely matching Janell and Dominic because it was:
       1) Looking for a voter in the swing riding willing to vote Liberal
       2) Looking for a non-swing voter who is willing to vote for Janell's preferred party and
          for whom Janell is willing to vote for her preferred party.
       3) The problem is that the algorithm wasn't checking to make sure the swing riding
          was one for the non-swing voter's preferred party.  Ie., it had Janell voting Liberal in 
          Riding A and Dominic voting Green for Janell in Riding B, but NDP is Dominic's preferred.

   Result: no match found.
